# Lume - My First Front-End Project

**Lume** is my first front-end project, built with **HTML** and **CSS** to showcase basic web design concepts. The name reflects the idea of bringing light through a simple, clean design.

## ðŸ’­ Final Thoughts

Lume was a small project that helped me build a solid foundation in front-end development. Itâ€™s a simple start, but Iâ€™m looking forward to more complex projects ahead!
